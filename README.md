# GO REST - REST API Framework in Go
[![Go version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-v1.20-brightgreen)](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Go REST is a REST API Framework written in Golang to help build Exactly Labs' solutions


## Usage

To use in your project, you need to add this module by calling:

```
go get github.com/exactlylabs.com/go-rest
```

Then, inside your application, import it:

```go

import "github.com/exactlylabs.com/go-rest"

```

### Examples

We currently don't have any documentation, but there's an `examples` directory that can help you understand how to use it.

The examples follow a numeric order, that increases the complexity as you go on
